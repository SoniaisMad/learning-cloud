### => Practice : Deploy a CloudFormation template from the AWS Console

What i learned : First time i used the framework, pretty impressed.

What was difficult : Documentation is super well explained, so not much difficulties here

### => Practice : Deploy a VPC with Terraform

[Link](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/OPS/OPS01/OPS01-AWS300.md)

What i learned : i already knew how to use terraform, i just struggled to declare all the right resources.

What was difficult : I did not know where to start, what resource depend on what, so i did it first on the console, to see what i needed to create and then i tried to do it on Terraform.
